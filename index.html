                <p class="article-text">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                    physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up
                    late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.</p>
                <p class="article-text">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of
                    some exotic particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
                    he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
                    hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself
                    with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                    faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant.</p>
                <p class="article-text">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes
                    like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
                    warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                    irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond
                    detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
                <p class="article-text">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,”
                    Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>

            <div class="article-par">
                <p class="article-text">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio
                    astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
                    that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

                    with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac
                    of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the
                    fabric of space-time — so-called <a class="css-1g7m0tk"

                        gravitational waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently
                    apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
                    second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation,
                    proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>





                <p class="article-text">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
                    many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
                <p class="article-text">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
                    comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang
                    itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>


                <p class="article-text">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
                    14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an
                    infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
                    Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling
                    into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

                    energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into
                    gravity
                    itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which,
                    according
                    to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
                <p class="article-text">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who
                    was
                    not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
                <p class="article-text">He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a
                    telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”</p>

                <p class="article-text">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
                    microwave
                    radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old
                    and
                    as
                    hot as the surface of the sun.</p>

                                    that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded
                                    faster than

                                    of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into

            <p class="article-text">In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation
                was
                polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than
                another.
            </p>
            <p class="article-text">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves
                from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by,
                would twist the direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
                polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>
            <p class="article-text">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences
                in
                the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting
                thermometer.</p>
            <p class="article-text">“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
            <p class="article-text">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year
                burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that
                competitors
                might beat them to the breakthrough.</p>

                Guth,
                staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the
                evolution of
                the universe.</p>

                <div class="css-53u6y8">
                    <p class="article-text">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity,
                        electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those
                        are
                        simply
                        different manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest,
                        hottest
                        moments.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from
                        grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of
                        physics
                        evolved, with one force after another splitting away.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the
                        temperature
                        falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing
                        latent
                        heat.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too
                        long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind
                        of
                        antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the
                        repulsive
                        force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a
                        trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a
                        grapefruit
                        —
                        in less than a cosmic eye-blink.</p>
                    <p class="article-text">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary
                        particles
                        and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable
                        universe, a
                        patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such
                        thing
                        as a
                        free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>

                        <p class="article-text">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a
                            Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
